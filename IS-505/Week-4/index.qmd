## We are Data {.smaller}

#### [**We are filled with data in today's networked society**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   through our web activity, we are assigned *gender, ethnicity, class, age, education level, and potential status of parent with x no. of children* ([digital trace data/digital footprint/digital breadcrumbs]{style="color: orange;"})

-   if internet metadata identifies a user as foreigner than they lose right to privacy afforded to U.S. citizens

-   who would have thought that [*class status, citizenship, ethnicity*]{.underline} could be algorithmically understood?

## We are Data (Cont.) {.smaller}

#### [**We live in a world of ubiquitous networked communication**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   technologies that constituent the Internet are so woven into the fabric of our daily lives, where for most of us, existing without seems unimaginable

#### [**We also live in a world of ubiquitous surveillance**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   same technologies have helped spawn an impressive network of governmental, commercial, and unaffiliated infrastructures of mass observation and control
-   most of what we do in this world has at least the **capacity** to be *observed, recorded, analyzed, and stored* in a databank
    -   HOW?
        -   storage is cheap
        -   computers are fast to analyze information in both real time & retrospective
        -   our daily activities that are mediated with software can be easily configured to record and report everything it sees upstream

## Human Construct

-   Metadata is a human construct and not found in nature
-   It is designed to solve particular problem
-   Nothing objective about it
-   It makes subjective statement
    -   what should be included
    -   what should be omitted
    -   where to draw boundaries
    -   what terms can be used to describe it

## Metadata: Definition {.smaller}

> ***Information in the library catalog***
>
> ***Metadata indicates something beyond the data: a statement or statements about the data***
>
> ***All metadata bears the imprint of its origins and intended use when examined closely enough***

-   Gilliland

    -   “the sum total of what one can say about an information object at any level of aggregation”
    -   “the value-added information that they create to arrange, describe, track, and otherwise enhance access to information objects and the physical collections related to those objects”

-   Pomerantz

    -   “Metadata is a statement about a potentially informative object”

## Metadata {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A simple web search from most unsophisticated smart phone generate lengthy record of new data including

    -   initial search term
    -   location of your phone
    -   time & date when you searched
    -   terms you searched before/after
    -   your phone operating system
    -   your phone's IP address
    -   information of apps on your phone

## Representative Statements {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   How should we create our statements?
-   We want statements that represent the aspects of information objects that will help users meet their goals
    -   i.e. to find, manage, select, locate, obtain
-   In a consistent way
    -   so that users can compare descriptions

    -   Search logs
    -   User tracking

## User-Generated Metadata {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Discussion {.smaller}

Evalyn Harper

> In "Metadata and Data Quality Problems in the Digital Library," Beall describes several commonly occurring errors in metadata that hinder the access of documents in digital libraries. As I was reading the article, I was reminded of an issue that comes up somewhat often at my circulation desk. The issue has to do with barcodes. The main stacks collection is so big, and so old, that not all of our items were assigned barcodes at the same time. There is a set of texts that were all given barcode labels, but the codes were never inputted into Alma. Just like the errors described in the Beall article, this hinders our ability to access the specific records associated with those items. Since we're not certain exactly which items this problem effects, it only gets fixed when someone attempts to check out an item and the system doesn't recognize the code on its sticker.

-   Take a few minutes to discuss with a neighbor – **what kind of different errors have you encountered in metadata systems in libraries/archives/museums**?

## Build your Online Metadata Collection {.smaller}

##### Instructions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Make a copy [metadata-template file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy?usp=sharing) in your Google Sheets

2.  Choose a topic of your interest and paste atleast 15-20 resources in the file (such as books written by a specific author, or books on a particular topic)

3.  Publish your Google Sheets and Paste the [Link here](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/)

4.  Visit the [Collection Builder-Sheets default template site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/assets/images/publish-sheet-web.gif) *Important: To view your objects on the prototype site, the files will need to be available externally on the web (e.g., hosted on your organization’s server or via a platform such as Digital Ocean or Reclaim Hosting). You can also host files for free via GitHub pages.*
:::
