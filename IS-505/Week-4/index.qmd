## WE ARE DATA {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### [**We are filled with data in today's networked society**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   through our web activity, we are assigned *gender, ethnicity, class, age, education level, and potential status of parent with x no. of children* ([digital trace data/digital footprint/digital breadcrumbs]{style="color: orange;"})

-   if internet metadata identifies a user as foreigner than they lose right to privacy afforded to U.S. citizens

-   who would have thought that [*class status, citizenship, ethnicity*]{.underline} could be algorithmically understood?

## WE ARE DATA (Cont.) {.smaller}

#### [**We live in a world of ubiquitous networked communication**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   technologies that constituent the Internet are so woven into the fabric of our daily lives, where for most of us, existing without seems unimaginable

#### [**We also live in a world of ubiquitous surveillance**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   same technologies have helped spawn an impressive network of governmental, commercial, and unaffiliated infrastructures of mass observation and control
-   most of what we do in this world has at least the **capacity** to be *observed, recorded, analyzed, and stored* in a databank
    -   HOW?
        -   storage is cheap
        -   computers are fast to analyze information in both real time & retrospective
        -   our daily activities that are mediated with software can be easily configured to record and report everything it sees upstream
