## Discussion {.smaller}

`Delia`

What technological "shortcuts" are you grateful for in your day to day? Are there tasks you wouldn't know how to do without the aid of your current set of technology? 

Who is most impacted when jobs that require "menial" or repetitive tasks are replaced by an advance in technology? How does the streamlining of a corporate or institutional practice through AI impact the time and money of the people involved? 

`Haley`

Do you think the fear of AI replaced librarians is a valid fear? Why or why not?

Since it's likely the job of the librarian will change with AI, what do you think these changes will look like? How will specialization and AI impact librarian's jobs?
