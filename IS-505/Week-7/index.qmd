## Indexing {.smaller}

> `Subject indexing is the process of describing a document using keywords, symbols, or other index terms`
>
> `Subject classification is the process of organizing materials into categories based on a scheme that identifies, distinguishes, and relates the materials' topics or concepts`

::: incremental
-   One basic problem involved in the process of subject indexing is the choice of appropriate keywords or descriptors though which index entry is to be represented

-   The indexer prefers to use keywords that represents the subject clearly & likely to be chosen by user when looking for the subject

-   In order to standardize the task of choosing appropriate keywords for generation of index entries, no. of vocabulary control devices have been developed such as thesaurus

-   These tools help the indexer to choose most appropriate term to represent the subject at indexing stage and help the users to pick most appropriate terms while formulating a query
:::

## Indexing (Cont.) {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   2 different indexers may analyse content of a given document in 2 different ways resulting in 2 different index entries (**Serious Drawback of Manual Indexing**)

-   To avoid total dependence on human intellect, researchers have attempted to automate the whole process of subject indexing & classification

-   Most of the systems developed so far for automatic content analysis are based on statistical calculation of occurrence of keywords in the documents

-   Given the shortcomings of such statistically based systems, researchers have suggested the need of syntactic & semantic analysis of text statements by using computational linguistics in the process of content analysis
:::

## Exhausivity and Specificity {.smaller}

*`More in Week 11 (Mar 26): Search and Information Retrieval`*

::: incremental
-   Effectiveness of an indexing system is controlled — **exhaustivity & term specificity**

-   [Exhaustivity]{style="color: blue;"} is the degree to which subject matter of a given document has been reflected through index entries

-   To attain exhaustivity, system has to select as many keywords as possible to represent the idea put forward in the document

-   [Specificity]{style="color: blue;"} refers to how broad or how specific are the terms or keywords chosen under a given situation. More specific the terms, better is the representation of the subject through the index entry

-   [Recall & Precision measure the effectiveness]{style="color: blue;"} of a systems where

    -- Recall = No. of relevant documents retrieved / No. of relevant documents in the collection

    -- Precision = No. of relevant documents retrieved / Total no. of documents retrieved

-   [More Exhaustivity]{style="color: blue;"}, [higher recall & lower precision]{style="color: red;"}

-   [More Specificity]{style="color: blue;"}, [higher precision & lower recall]{style="color: red;"}
:::

## Controlled Vocabulary {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Vocabulary is a [set of terms]{style="color: blue;"} (words, codes, etc.) that are used in a specific community

-   When a vocabulary is [formally *managed*]{style="color: blue;"}, it becomes **Controlled Vocabulary**

-   Where *managed* means the terms are stored & maintained using agreed-upon *procedures*

-   *Procedures* should exist for adding terms, modifying terms, & more rarely, deprecating terms from a controlled vocabulary

-   CV is a [carefully selected list of words and phrase]{style="color: blue;"}, which are used to tag units of information so that they may be more easily retrieved by a search

-   The terms are [chosen by]{style="color: blue;"} and organized by trained professionals (including Librarians and information scientist) who posses expertise in the subject area

-   CV terms can [accurately describe what a given document is actually about]{style="color: blue;"}, even if the terms themselves do not occurs within the text

-   Fully developed CV systems are [LCSH, Sears List, Thesaurus]{style="color: blue;"} etc.

## Difference Between Index & Controlled Vocabulary {.smaller}

|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **End product**  | index           | term list                                               |
| **Use**          | content locator | content tagging, website navigation, search enhancement |
| **Project time** | weeks           | months                                                  |
| **Methodology**  | reading         | research                                                |

## Subject Headings {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Also called as `subject terms/index terms/index keywords`

-   A subject heading is a short topic description, taken from a defined list of terms, which is organized into categories

## Subject Headings (Cont.) {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In compared to keywords, subject headings:
    -   [they give single consistent description of a topic]{style="color: blue;"}

## Subject Headings (Cont.) {.smaller}

-   In compared to keywords, subject headings:
    -   [they are organized into categories/hierarchy structure]{style="color: blue;"}

![](images/search.png)

## When to Use Subject Headings? {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   You have a lot of synonyms
-   A topic is hard to describe in a short phrase
-   You want to search across a whole category of topics
-   To make any systematic search more rigorous
