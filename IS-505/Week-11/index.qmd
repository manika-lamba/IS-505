## Information Retrieval {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   It is a subfield of information science

    -   concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information

    -   Information retrieval research is concerned with novel methods, algorithms and systems

    -   The results have shaped web search systems

## Information Retrieval (Cont.) {.smaller}

`What are We Retrieving in Information Retrieval?`

-   Documents which contain information and come from a document collection (or “file”)
    -   The canonical documents in IR are scientific journal articles

`What documents do we want to retrieve?`

-   Ones with information that is relevant to some information need

-   Loosely speaking, a relevant document contains the information that a person was looking for when they submitted a query to the search engine

## Google Search Algorithm

## Search: Finding the word

-   The simplest form of document retrieval is for a computer to do this sort of linear scan through documents
    -   start at the beginning
    -   read through all the text
    -   if you find a match for the string such as "Brutus", include the document in the result set

## Search: Build an Index {.smaller}

-   For each document
    -   record whether it contains each word out of all the words Shakespeare used
-   Result is a term-document incidence matrix

![](images/matrix.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

-   Now we have two kinds of vectors: - one for each term, showing which docs it appears in - one for each doc, showing which terms appear in it


## Search: Building a Better Retrieval Model {.smaller}

-   A Boolean model only records term presence or abscence,
-   but often we would like to accumulate evidence, giving more weight to documents that have a term several times as opposed to ones that contain it only once
-   To be able to do this we need *term frequency* information
