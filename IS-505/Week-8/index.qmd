**`Ten common characteristics of big data`**

-   **Big** - *large datasets are a means to an end; they are not an end in themselves*

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
*\[Our\] corpus contains over 500 billion words, in English (361 billion), French (45 billion), Spanish (45 billion), German (37 billion), Chinese (13 billion), Russian (35 billion), and Hebrew (2 billion) [(Michel et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1199644)*
:::

- **Always-on** - *helps to identify unexpected events and real-time measurement*

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
*[Ceren Budak and Duncan Watts (2015)]( https://doi.org/10.15195/v2.a18) were able to do more by using the always-on nature of Twitter to study protesters who used Twitter before, during, and after the event. And, they were able to create a comparison group of nonparticipants before, during, and after the event*
:::

- **Nonreactive** - *Measurement in big data sources is much less likely to change behavior*

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
*One challenge of social research is that people can change their behavior when they know that they are being observed by researchers. Social scientists generally call this reactivity*
